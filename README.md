# Task_4_Global-terrorism-data-analysis
I've made this project as a part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation under Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) . My task was to Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism Data’ and do the following:
●	As a security/defense analyst, try to ﬁnd out the hot zone of terrorism.
●	What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

This dataset contains a lot of features, so you can use the codebook to derive meaning out of those feature names. You can download the codebook from this repository.
